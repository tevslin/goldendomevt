# GoldenDomeVT

## WIP

will soon contain the code which implements GoldenDomeVT.com and SmartTranscripts.

This repository is particular to the site GoldenDomeVT.com which is a factory for creating and serving SmartTranscripts of committee and floor meetings of the Vermont Legislature.SmartTrancripts are text transcripts linked to actual videos in such a way that a user can select text and immediately play the corresponding video clip in an imbedded viewer appropriate to the video type. Much of the code is general and can be used to create SmartTrancripts from a variety of online video sources but some of it uses specific S3 Buckets and URLs whose names are hardcoded as defaults. These need to be replaced with folders or your own s3 buckets to run the code for other sites. It also ruins off a list of YouTube channels used by the Vermont Legislature so, at least, needs a different channel list for meetings of other entities.
