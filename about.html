<h1>About <i>GoldenDomeVT</i> and <i>SmartTranscripts<i></h1>

<p>The purpose of <b>GoldenDomeVT</b>
is to make meetings of the Vermont Legislature and its 26 standing committees more accessible
and transparent - especially to reporters, local officials, bloggers, lobbyists, and
others who have a vital interest in what the legislature does or doesn't do.</p>

<p><b>SmartTranscripts</b> are computer-generated
transcriptions of meetings which are accessible almost as soon as the
videos are posted to YouTube. SmartTranscripts, unlike video, are searchable by keywords, phrases, 
or speakers so you can quickly find what's important to you in the meeting.
The "smart" part of <b>SmartTranscripts</b> is that they are linked to
the official videos of the meeting. Just select
the text you're interested in and you'll instantly see
and hear the clip of that part of the meeting. Emotion and body-language are
also important for understanding what is actually happening; clips let you hear how something was
said and how someone looked when they said it. You can often see the reaction
of others to the speaker.</p>

<p>The <b>Search</b> function on the <b>GoldenDomeVT</b> home page allows you to find all transcripts
from the 2025 session of the legislature which contain specific words or phrases or in which a specific person speaks or is mentioned.</p>

<p><b>SmartTranscripts</b> of committee meetings support direct email to committee members.</p>

<p>Like closed captioning, computer transcriptions 
contain inaccuracies although they are often more faithful
to what was actually said than human transcriptions; but access to video clips
lets you assure the accuracy of anything important.</p> 

<p>Most of the work of the legislature is done by the 15
standing committees in the House and 11 in the Senate. Most of them meet once
or more a day during the session. There are not nearly enough reporters
to attend all those meetings and it's hard to tell in advance which will be
important. Since Covid, the meetings have been on Zoom and the legislature posts
videos shortly after the meeting on YouTube. But watching a video of a
three-hour committee meeting to find a few crucial moments is time consuming
and tedious. <b>SmartTranscripts</b> enable the
few reporters covering the statehouse to "see" more of what's happening in the
committee rooms.</p>

<p>During the 2025 legislative session, <b>SmartTranscripts</b> will be posted on <a href="https://www.goldendomevt.com"> GoldenDomeVT</a> 
almost as soon as the videos appear on YouTube. Feedback is welcome
through <a href="mailto:contact@goldendomevt.com">Contact Us</a></p>

<h2>The fine print</h2>

<p><b>GoldenDomeVt</b> and the <b>SmartTranscripts</b> are free and require no registration to use.
They do not use cookies. They do not request personal information although the
website follows the usual practice of gathering traffic data including the IP
addresses it is accessed from and the browsers and devices used for access. The
actual transcribing is done by a commercial service called Deepgram. Speaker
identification is done using OpenAI's ChatGPT. Videos clips are displayed with YouTube's
viewer, which follows its usual cookie practice. The videos of the meetings are
posted on YouTube by the legislature. They are linked to by <b>SmartTranscripts</b>
but not copied or modified in any way. All the code written specifically for
this project is open source and public domain and will shortly be published on
<a href="https://github.com/tevslin">github</a>.</p>

<p>This service is a shareware project by <a
href="https://blog.tomevslin.com/about-tom-evslin.html">Tom Evslin</a> of
Stowe, Vermont. It is available free but with no warranty of any kind nor any
commitment to keep the service available or fix bugs. <b>SmartTranscripts</b> 
do contain inaccuracies and speaker identification is still experimental.
No use should be made of a quote without playing the associated clip to verify who
said what and how they said it. </p>
